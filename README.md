# Image-Classification-
This is a supervised machine learning project that involves image classification. 
## What is image classification and how does this help businesses.
Image classification is the process of assigning a label or a category to an image, based on its visual content. This process is performed using machine learning algorithms, particularly supervised learning techniques, where a model is trained on a labeled dataset of images to recognize patterns and features that distinguish between different classes of objects.
## Examples of Use cases across industries
The applications of image classification are numerous and beneficial to companies in different industries. For example, image classification can be used in e-commerce to enable customers to search for products by uploading images of similar items, making product search faster and more accurate. It can also be used in healthcare to analyze medical images, identify disease patterns, and diagnose medical conditions. In the automotive industry, image classification can be used for object detection, lane detection, and pedestrian detection in self-driving cars. In general, image classification can help companies automate repetitive tasks, improve the accuracy of image-based decision-making, and enhance the overall customer experience.
## Best Practices when building a supervised machine learning for image classification:
When building a supervised machine learning model for image classification, there are several best practices to follow. Firstly, it is essential to have a well-labeled dataset of images that covers all the possible categories that the model will be expected to classify. Secondly, it is crucial to choose a deep learning algorithm, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that is designed to handle large volumes of image data and extract relevant features from images. Lastly, it is important to split the dataset into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance and avoid overfitting.
